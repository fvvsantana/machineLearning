# Complex Networks

## Description

This project was made with the intention of learning to use different machine learning techniques in R. There is no real implementation of the algorithms in this repository, we just use it.
The main concepts/algorithms present in this repository are:
* K-means clustering
* K-nearest neighbors algorithm
* Naive Bayes classifier
* K-Fold Cross-Validation

On top of each file there is a description of what it is about.

## Tech stack
* R (Caret)
