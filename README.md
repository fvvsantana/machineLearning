# Learning Machine Learning

## Description

This project was made for learning to use different machine learning techniques in R. There is no real implementation of the algorithms in this repository, we just use it.

The main concepts/algorithms presented in this repository are:
* K-means clustering
* K-nearest neighbors algorithm
* Naive Bayes classifier
* K-Fold Cross-Validation

On top of each file, there is a description of what the file is about.

## Tech stack
* R (Caret)
